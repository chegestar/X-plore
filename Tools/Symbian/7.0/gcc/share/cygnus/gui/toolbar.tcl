# Pass this proc a frame and some children of the frame.  It will put

# Children are added in the order they are listed.  If a child's name

# For non-flat mode, each button must display an image, and this image
# must have a twin.  The primary (raised) image's name must end in
# "u", and the depressed image's name must end in "d".  Eg the edit
# images should be called "editu" and "editd".  There's no doubt that
# this is a hack.

# If you want to add a button that doesn't have an image (or whose
# image doesn't have a twin), you must wrap it in a frame.
